  "changelog_summary": "## v0.5.1 (2026-02-23) Added: - Stronger licence entitlement checks before updates are applied, with clearer operator messaging when an update is not permitted. Fixed: - Trial behaviour could previously be too permissive for update and data-transfer operations in some flows. Changed: - Trial licences are now limited to 7 days with tighter server-side enforcement. - Public update delivery now exposes only the current stable release payload.",
