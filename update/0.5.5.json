  "changelog_summary": "## v0.5.5 (2026-02-23) Added: - Installer now provisions a host-level `ordersys` command at `/usr/local/bin/ordersys`. Fixed: - Hosted updater now attempts key recovery from the installer payload when local manifest key verification fails. - Installer now bundles the local CLI payload so operator commands are available on installed hosts. Changed: - Release automation now derives installer-embedded public key from the active manifest-signing private key.",
