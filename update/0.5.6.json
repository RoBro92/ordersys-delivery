  "changelog_summary": "## v0.5.6 (2026-02-24) Added: - Production command-line experience now presents a production-only command set on installed systems. - Installer repair/update flows now consistently route updates through the licence-gated updater path. Fixed: - Closed a path where installer re-run actions could apply updates outside the normal update entitlement checks. - Improved resilience when a host has a launcher command but missing local CLI payload files. Changed: - Public key material used for licence verification and installer-distributed trust has been rotated to the new production key set.",
